# Book Review Machine Learning Model

I built a sentiment analysis model to classify book reviews as either positive or negative, using the review text as the main feature. This binary classification problem helps determine the overall tone of customer feedback. The model can add value for companies by identifying which books are well-received, enabling better recommendation systems. For example, books with positive reviews can be promoted to more users, while readers who leave favorable feedback can be recommended similar titles or other works by the same author. This approach supports personalized marketing, improves user engagement, and provides insights into customer preferences.
